FastKafka is a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for building asynchronous services that interact with Kafka topics. Built on top of Pydantic, AIOKafka and AsyncAPI, FastKafka simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for Kafka topics, handling all the parsing, networking, task scheduling and data generation automatically. 

Every FastKafka application must consists the following components:

  - Messages
  - Application
  - Function decorators

Messages:

In FastKafka, messages represent the data that users publish or consume from specific Kafka topic. The structure of these messages is defined using Pydantic, which simplifies the process of specifying fields and their data types. FastKafka utilizes Pydantic to seamlessly parse JSON-encoded data into Python objects, enabling easy handling of structured data in Kafka-based applications.

Example: Here's an example of a message for a simple use case:

```python
from typing import *
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, NonNegativeFloat


class StoreProduct(BaseModel):
    product_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the product")
    currency: str = Field(..., description="Currency")
    price: NonNegativeFloat = Field(..., description="Price of the product")
```

In the provided example, the "StoreProduct" message class is inherited from Pydantic's BaseModel class and includes three fields: "product_name," "currency," and "price." Pydantic's "Field" function is used to specify the properties of each field, including their data types and descriptions.

Application:

We can create a new application object by initialising the FastKafka class with the minimum set of arguments. Below is the function declaration of the FastKafka constructor:

```python
class FastKafka:
    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        title: Optional[str] = None,
        description: Optional[str] = None,
        version: Optional[str] = None,
        contact: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,
        kafka_brokers: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
        root_path: Optional[Union[Path, str]] = None,
        lifespan: Optional[Callable[["FastKafka"], AsyncContextManager[None]]] = None,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ):
        """Creates FastKafka application

                the title will be set to empty string
            description: optional description for the documentation. If
                None, the description will be set to empty string

                the bootstrap server when running the applicationa and for

                manager, e.g.:`async with kafka_app...`

        """
        pass
```

Example: Creating a new FastKafka app by passing the minimum set of arguments. In this case "kafka_brokers".

```python
from fastkafka import FastKafka

kafka_brokers = {
    "localhost": {
        "url": "localhost",
        "description": "local development kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
    },
    "production": {
        "url": "kafka.airt.ai",
        "description": "production kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
        "protocol": "kafka-secure",
        "security": {"type": "plain"},
    },
}

kafka_app = FastKafka(
    title="Demo Kafka app",
    kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers,
)
```
In the provided example, the kafka_brokers is a dictionary containing entries for local development and production Kafka brokers. These entries specify the URL, port, and other broker details, which are used for both generating documentation and running the server against the specified Kafka broker.

Function decorators in FastKafka:

FastKafka provides two convenient decorator functions: @kafka_app.consumes and @kafka_app.produces. These decorators are used for consuming and producing data to and from Kafka topics. They also handle the decoding and encoding of JSON-encoded messages.

@kafka_app.consumes decorator function:

You can use the @kafka_app.consumes decorator to consume messages from Kafka topics.

Example: Consuming messages from a "hello_world" topic

```python
from typing import *
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HelloWorld(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(
        ..., description="Name to send in a Kafka topic"
    )

@kafka_app.consumes(topic="hello_world")
async def on_hello_world(msg: HelloWorld):
    print(f"Got msg: {msg.name}")
```
In the provided example, the @kafka_app.consumes decorator is applied to the on_hello_world function, indicating that this function should be called whenever a message is received on the "hello_world" Kafka topic. The on_hello_world function takes a single argument, which is expected to be an instance of the HelloWorld message class. When a message is received, the function prints the name field from the message.

@kafka_app.consumes decorator function:

You can use @kafka_app.produces decorator to produce messages to Kafka topics.

Example: Producing messages to a "hello_world" topic

```python
from typing import *
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HelloWorld(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(
        ..., description="Name to send in a kafka topic"
    )

@kafka_app.produces(topic="hello_world")
async def to_hello_world(name: str) -> HelloWorld:
    return HelloWorld(name=name)
```

In this example, the @kafka_app.produces decorator is applied to the to_hello_world function. This decorator indicates that calling the to_hello_world function not only returns an instance of the HelloWorld class but also sends the return value to the "hello_world" Kafka topic.

Below is a comprehensive code example for producing and consuming data using FastKafka. We will create a basic FastKafka application that consumes data from the "input_data" topic, logs the data using a logger, and then produces the incremented data to the "output_data" topic.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, NonNegativeFloat

from fastkafka import FastKafka
from fastkafka._components.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)

class Data(BaseModel):
    data: NonNegativeFloat = Field(
        ..., example=0.5, description="Float data example"
    )

kafka_brokers = {
    "localhost": {
        "url": "localhost",
        "description": "local development kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
    },
    "production": {
        "url": "kafka.airt.ai",
        "description": "production kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
        "protocol": "kafka-secure",
        "security": {"type": "plain"},
    },
}

kafka_app = FastKafka(
    title="Demo Kafka app",
    kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers,
)

@kafka_app.consumes(topic="input_data", auto_offset_reset="latest")
async def on_input_data(msg: Data):
    logger.info(f"Got data: {msg.data}")
    await to_output_data(msg.data)


@kafka_app.produces(topic="output_data")
async def to_output_data(data: float) -> Data:
    processed_data = Data(data=data+1.0)
    return processed_data
```
In the given code, we create a FastKafka application using the FastKafka() constructor with the title and the kafka_brokers arguments.We define the Data message class using Pydantic to represent the data with an integer value. The application is configured to consume messages from the "input_data" topic, log the data using a logger named "data_logger," and then produce the incremented data to the "output_data" topic.

Using this code, messages can be processed end-to-end, allowing you to consume data, perform operations, and produce the result back to another Kafka topic with ease.

Instructions you must follow while generating plan:

- The plan must include AT LEAST one app and one entity.
- The entities should never be set to []. Pay close attention to the ==== APP DESCRIPTION: ==== section and generate an appropriate entity.
- The app_name should be in lower letters and can have "underscore".
- Both "entities" and "apps" can't be empty lists. Each entity in the "entities" list should have a "name" and "arguments" specified in JSON format. The "arguments" should be defined as key-value pairs where the keys represent the argument names, and the values represent the argument types.
- All classes and enums described in the "==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====" section should be included in the "entities" list.
- In the apps, the "kafka_brokers" attribute should only include explicitly defined brokers from the "==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====" section. If no kafka brokers are defined, set the "kafka_brokers" attribute in apps to "null".
- Consume function names should follow the format: prefix + "_" + topic name. If the user doesn't explicitly define the prefix for the consumes function, the default prefix "on" should be used.
- Produce function names should follow the format: prefix + "_" + topic name. If the user doesn't explicitly define the prefix for the produces function, the default prefix "to" should be used.
- Every consumes function in the "consumes_functions" must have the following attributes defined: "topic", "prefix,", "parameters" and "description".
- Every produces function in the "produces_functions" must have the following attributes defined: "topic", "prefix", "parameters", "description", and "return".
- You have a habit of missing out "returns" in "produces_functions". Remember each function in "produces_functions" must have the "return" key defined, and it SHOULD NOT never be set to "None" or missed out from the dictionary. Pay close attention to the ==== APP DESCRIPTION: ==== section and generate an appropriate return.
- The attributes "parameters" and "returns" of the consumes function and produces function cannot be primitive types (e.g., str, int, float, bool). They must inherit from a data model like Pydantic BaseModel.
- The "parameters" of the consumes function and produces function cannot be an empty list.
- ALWAYS name the first parameter of the consume function as "msg".
- The "description" parameter of the produces and consumes function should be very detailed and include step by step instructions which can be used to implement the business logic without any confusions. Pay close attention to the ==== APP DESCRIPTION: ==== section and generate the description. 
- You should always start the "description" parameter of the produces and consumes function like "This function" and should never use "Implement the business logic to " in your response. Instead write detailed business logic as instructions.

Please respond with a valid JSON plan only. No other text should be included in the response.

Testing FastKafka apps:
In order to speed up development and make testing easier, we have implemented the Tester class.
The Tester instance starts in-memory implementation of Kafka broker i.e. there is no need for starting localhost Kafka service for testing FastKafka apps. The Tester will redirect consumes and produces decorated functions to the in-memory Kafka broker so that you can quickly test FasKafka apps without the need of a running Kafka broker and all its dependencies. Also, for each FastKafka consumes and produces function, Tester will create it's mirrored fuction i.e. if the consumes function is implemented, the Tester will create the produces function (and the other way - if the produces function is implemented, Tester will create consumes function).

Basic example:
To showcase the functionalities of FastKafka and illustrate the concepts discussed, we can use a simple test message called TestMsg. Here's the definition of the TestMsg class:

"""
class TestMsg(BaseModel):
    msg: str = Field(...)
"""

In this example we have implemented FastKafka app with one consumes and one produces function. on_input function consumes messages from the input topic and to_output function produces messages to the output topic.

Additional strong guidelines for you to follow:
- if app has a conusme on_topic function, app can check if the function was called wit the right parameters:
"""
await app.awaited_mocks.on_topic.assert_called_with(
    msg, timeout=5
)
"""

- if app has a conusme on_topic function, tester can produce message to that topic:  await tester.to_topic(msg)
- if app has a produces to_topic function, app can produce message to that topic:  await app.to_topic(msg)
- if app has a produces to_topic function, tester can consume message from that topic and check if it was called with the correct arguments:
"""
await tester.awaited_mocks.on_topic.assert_called_with(
    msg, timeout=5
)
"""

Rules:
- if app has a conusme on_topic function, tester CAN NOT consume message from that topic and check if it was called with the correct arguments:: 
"""
await tester.awaited_mocks.on_topic.assert_called_with(
    msg, timeout=5
)
"""
- if app has a produces to_topic function, tester CAN NOT produce message to that topic:  await tester.to_topic(msg)

Add to the end of the python sctipt async test function and within it use Tester class for testing this app
The response should be an executable Python script only, with no additional text!!!!!

==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====
Create FastKafka application which consumes messages from the store_product topic, it consumes messages with three attributes: product_name, currency and price. While consuming, it should produce a message to the change_currency topic. input parameters for this producing function should be store_product object and function should store_product. produces function should check if the currency in the input store_product parameter is "HRK", currency should be set to "EUR" and the price should be divided with 7.5.
