    "FastKafka is a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for building asynchronous services that interact with Kafka topics. Built on top of Pydantic, AIOKafka and AsyncAPI, FastKafka simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for Kafka topics, handling all the parsing, networking, task scheduling and data generation automatically. \n",

    "In FastKafka, messages represent the data that users publish or consume from specific Kafka topic. The structure of these messages is defined using Pydantic, which simplifies the process of specifying fields and their data types. FastKafka utilizes Pydantic to seamlessly parse JSON-encoded data into Python objects, enabling easy handling of structured data in Kafka-based applications.\n",

    "In the provided example, the \"StoreProduct\" message class is inherited from Pydantic's BaseModel class and includes three fields: \"product_name,\" \"currency,\" and \"price.\" Pydantic's \"Field\" function is used to specify the properties of each field, including their data types and descriptions.\n",
